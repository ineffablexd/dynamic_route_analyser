qgisMinimumVersion=1.0
description = Real-time dynamic route analysis tool for QGIS that calculates vertex angles and segment lengths in meters using automatic CRS detection and UTM projection handling.
about = The plugin dynamically updates vertex angles and segment distances in real time when geometry is modified. It intelligently handles projected and geographic coordinate systems by applying automatic UTM reprojection when necessary. 

Key Features:
- Real-time vertex angle calculation
- Segment length calculation always in meters
- Dynamic UTM zone selection (North/South hemisphere support)
- Optimized for engineering workflows and transmission line routing
